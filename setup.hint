sdesc: "C semantic parser"
ldesc: "Sparse, the semantic parser, provides a compiler frontend 
capable of parsing most of ANSI C as well as many GCC extensions, and a 
collection of sample compiler backends, including a static analyzer also 
called 'sparse'. Sparse provides a set of annotations designed to convey 
semantic information about types, such as what address space pointers 
point to, or what locks a function acquires or releases."
